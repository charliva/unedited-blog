  Since 2020, minimalist design has become increasingly popular. Let's
  explore what makes it so compelling, its origins, and why it continues
  to dominate modern design.

    What's minimalistic design?
  </h2>
  <p className="leading-relaxed mb-6">
    Minimalist design is a design focused on its sole purpose, without
    extreme or expressive colors or components. It embraces the principle
    of having only what is required and no more, thus forcing the creator
    to make very concious decisions about design choices. It's about
    designing the essential elements to perfection, limiting the amount of
    unneccessary distractions.

    Where did the style originate?
  </h2>
  <p className="leading-relaxed mb-6">
    The style originated from the 1960 Bauhaus style and the Dutch 'De
    Stijl' movement, emphasizing simplicity and functionality. One of the
    most influential minimalist designers is Dieter Rams, who created the
    10 principles of good design. His work at Braun and Vitsoe had a great
    impact on the world of minimalist design and continues to influence
    modern design thinking.

    <li>Good design makes a product understandable</li>
    <li>Good design is unobtrusive</li>
    <li>Good design is honest</li>
    <li>Good design is long-lasting</li>
    <li>Good design is thorough down to the last detail</li>
    <li>Good design is environmentally friendly</li>

    What makes minimalist design special?

  <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-gray-400 dark:border-gray-800 pl-4 my-6 italic">
    "Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but
    when there is nothing left to take away."
    <footer className="text-sm mt-2">â€” Antoine de Saint-Exupery</footer>
  </blockquote>
  <p className="leading-relaxed">
    Minimalism creates a sense of timelessness by using neutral colors and
    focusing on essential elements. Its monochromatic color scheme with
    fewer accents distinguishes it from other design styles, pushing
    forward the main message while making the user's experience meaningful
    and easy-going.

    The benefits of minimalist design
  </h2>
  <p className="leading-relaxed mb-6">
    Minimalist design has many benefits, both for the user and the creator of the design.
    Mainly, it helps to create a more focused and less cluttered design, which can lead
    to a better user experience. It also helps to create a more timeless design, as minimalist
    designs tend to age better than more complex designs. But also the use of nerd fonts,
    like JetBrains Mono, can help the user experience be more fluent and make the content
    easier to read.
